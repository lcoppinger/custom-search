            <h2>10Minutes on the OECD's BEPS project</h2>
            <p>The international tax system is changing rapidly as a result of coordinated actions by governments and of unilateral measures designed by individual countries, both intended to tackle concerns  over base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) and perceived international tax avoidance techniques of high-profile multinationals. The recommendations of the BEPS Project led by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  and published in October 2015 are at the root of much of the coordinated activity, although the timing and methods of implementation vary. At the completion of this scheduled programme, it started to be recognised as the end of phase one of the project and the start of phase two, dealing with outstanding or additional work, implementation and monitoring.</p>
            <p>The OECDâ€™s Action Plan on BEPS was published in July 2013 with a view to addressing perceived flaws in international tax rules. The 40 page Action Plan, which was negotiated and drafted with the active participation of its member states, contained 15 separate action points or work streams, some of which were further split into specific actions or outputs. The Plan was squarely focused on addressing these issues in a coordinated, comprehensive manner, and was endorsed by G20 leaders and finance ministers at their summit in St. Petersburg in September 2013.</p>
