            <h2>Bringing innovation and value to major projects</h2>
            <p>Over the past few years, I’ve noticed an interesting tendency among capital projects clients who say they’re seeking to be innovative and progressive. Reading between the lines, I often find that what they’re really looking for is a new system or piece of technology – usually a whizzy, highly graphical software application that they feel will solve their innovation deficit for them at a stroke.</p>
            <p>If only life – and business – were really so simple. The misconception that technology and innovation are the same thing is widespread in many industries, not just major projects. But in every sector, the fact is that technology is just part of the story, and will only drive innovation if it’s combined with wider and deeper change across the organisation, including behaviour, culture, capability and processes.</p>
