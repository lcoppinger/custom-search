            <h2>Leaks and public scandals have put corporate transparency firmly under the spotlight.</h2>
            <p>Citizens want to see and governments want to be seen to be taking a hard line on all forms of financial crime. This means shedding light onto who really owns and benefits from companies – making sure that they are legitimate and not a smokescreen for crime or funding terrorism. Transparency demands that we establish exactly who is the Ultimate Benificial Owner (UBO).</p>
            <p>It’s been a longstanding aim of global groups such as the G7, World Bank, International Monetary Fund and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – to determine the real owners of companies by deconstructing complex company structures. But the EU has taken action by mandating that each state creates a UBO register. This initiative is central to the fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD IV) as states agree that company misuse can be solved by greater transparency of company ownership. But, as no country has a comprehensive UBO register[1], there is much to discuss and deliver before the directive comes into full effect on 26 June 2017.</p>
